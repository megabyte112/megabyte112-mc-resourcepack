A Minecraft resource pack I made, thanks for downloading <3

Download from the releases page (on the right) and place it in your minecraft directory's resourcepacks folder, there's no need to unzip.

If you have the pack installed and would like to check your version number, click the copyright info in the bottom right of the title screen to view the game credits - the resource pack info is at the top.
