A Minecraft resource pack I made, thanks for downloading <3

This resource pack adds many tweaks and "enhancements" to the game, most of which are taken from VanillaTweaks, but some are also handmade.

These tweaks include, but are not limited to:
- Ores that glow
- Ore Borders that connect to each other, and also glow
- Spyglass becoming the "WHAT" meme
- Custom Splashes
- Meme paintings, and also nice scenery paintings
- 3D flowers and mushrooms
- A LOT of renamed items (Sheep -> Shep, Shulker -> Shukler, Kelp -> Klep, etc)
- Netherite tools and armor have visible diamonds that glow in the dark
- Plus many more I forgot to mention!

Download from the releases page (on the right) and place it in your minecraft directory's resourcepacks folder, there's no need to unzip.

If you have the pack installed and would like to check your version number, click the copyright info in the bottom right of the title screen to view the game credits - the resource pack info is at the top.

If the custom names aren't working, make sure your language is set to English United States.

Make sure OptiFine is installed for connected, emissive, and HD textures.

There is a known bug where shields with banners become glitched when wearing netherite armour or holding a netherite tool. As far as I am aware, this is a bug in OptiFine's Emissive Textures and there's nothing i can do about it - sorry!
